# Product Matching Portuguese

## About the Problem and Its Resolution
Product matching is an important problem in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data mining. It refers to the task of determining whether two products are equivalent or correspond to each other based on their textual descriptions and other associated metadata. Solutions to this problem are widely used in English worldwide. With this in mind, it became necessary to study and attempt to implement a solution in the context of the Portuguese language.

## About This Project
Several steps were followed to carry out the project:

- Selected several websites in Portuguese that sell products in the "smartphones" category.
- Implemented various crawlers to capture the information provided based on schema.org/products.
- Used the deepmatcher library to match products and measure the results' metrics.
